  <p>
    I never know how to start these things, so let's go over the
    <span class="underline decoration-sky-400 decoration-2 underline-offset-4">basics</span>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm a product manager and web developer based in Los Angeles California.</li>
    <li>I live with my beautiful girlfriend and our two dogs Snowbear and Luna.</li>
    <li>Even though I live in sunny-LA, I love the rain!</li>
    <li>I dabble in writing and world-building (for D&D and short stories)</li>
    <li>
      I have a lot of opinions on product design, project management, software development, optimal room temperature
      (68ºF fyi)...I could go on.
    </li>
  </ul>
